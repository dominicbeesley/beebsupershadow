Patching DNFS
=============

Need to trick it into thinking Tube is active
	- but not so much that things start to fail
		Not Tube Host setup etc
		Does it use the Tube apart from these transfers?

	9689 checks for Tube presence, stores flag at 0d67 (before claiming NMI region?!)
		doesn't seem to get called on boot, load, *disc, etc

	b467 also - and this one does get called
		could patch b469 -  nop : ldx #$ff

Change Tube initiations to setting up shadow transfers
	0406 - A=0,A=1 - XY point to 4-byte address
	       A=$C1 - claim
	       A=$81 - release

Change Tube FIFO interactions to jsrs to shadow routines
	sta tube_host_r3_data => send byte from A, increment address
		ad37, adb0
	lda tube_host_r3_data => load byte into A, increment address
		ad13, adbd

	what are these? not in NMI handler:
		8ba9 - transfer from page f
		93bf, 93c2 - discard two bytes


Plan
====
Not very thorough as I don't have a full disassembly and it's incredibly heavy-going... but...

$0406 contains a routine to set the data transfer address for future operations

Need to patch the ROM:
	* NMI handlers to call shadow_data_read and shadow_data_write instead of Tube ops
	* Tube presence detection to always think it's present
