Patching DFS 2.26
=================

Notes based on the partial disassembly in py8dis


* The NMI routines are daunting as they use a lot of self-modifying code
* The core routine self-modifies in various ways:
	* 9011, 9016, 9036, 903b - to advance the read/write memory address
	* 8ff5, 901d - to chain to exit code at the right time
* In addition when the handler is installed it immediately gets patched:
	* 8fa5, 8fac - to convert it to write rather than read
	* 8fb9 - to apply the initial memory address, if it's not a Tube transfer
	* 8fc7 - to prevent incrementing the memory address, if it is a Tube transfer


8f3f reads Tube presence using OSBYTE EA, and stores the inverted result at 10d6

In the NMI handler, 900e writes to the Tube and 9030 reads from the Tube - these need to be replaced with jsrs
	- but probably dynamically as the lda/sta that's there already is correct for non-Tube reads/writes

00a1 - b7=use Tube, b6=write

*RUN
890a - seems to check if the two top bytes of exec address, anded together, equal the Tube presence flag at 10d6
		if so, it calls tube_entry with a=4 (execute in copro)


9811 - uses Tube presence flag as well
	1063,1064 must contain high bytes of address
	if it's a host address, beq at 9817 will be taken
	or if tube flag is all ones
	8f6b gets called for Tube transfers
	1081 also gets set to ff
	and carry, so 9827 only on tube
		=> tube entry, a=from 107f
